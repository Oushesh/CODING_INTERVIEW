Reference: 391. Perfect Rectangle
## Given N axis-aligned rectangles where N> 0. Determine if they
## all together form an exact cover of a rectangular region.
## Each rectangle is represented as a bottom-left and a top-right
## point. For example, a unit square is represented as [(1,1),(2,2)]
## (coordinate of bottom-left point is (1,1) and top-right point is ## (2,2)).
##


##
  ## Example: [[(1,1),(3,3)],[(3,1),(4,2)], [(3,2),(4,4)],[(1,3),(2,4)],[(2,3),(3,4)]]


##
  ## Return True. All 5 sub rectangles form an exact rectangle
