##Word Break
  Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of non-empty words, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words

##
    Note:
     1) The same word in the dictionary may be used multiple times in the segmentation
     2) You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.

##
  Example 1:
  Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict =["leet", "code"]
  Output: true
  Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".

##
  Example 2:
  Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple", "pen"]
  Output: true
  Explanation: Return

##
  Example 3:
  Input s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats", "dog","sand","and","cat"]
  Output: false
