String permutation.cpp

1. We already wrote in python, now in C++. If we do an elementwise
   to elementwise comparion we have a complexity of O(nÂ²)

2. The other optimisation is to find the words based on a dictionary
   that exsited and reduce the search complexity. Walk the interviwer
   through it and how much optisaion can be done. In best case
   the word shuffling is done such that the words can be directly querried
   from the dictionary. in worst case we have a permutation that lexically
   ununderstandable.

3. Build an ascii map --> sort it out according numbers

This algorithm has the same complexity as the one implemented in Python:

 the same length amounting to the same O(n)
