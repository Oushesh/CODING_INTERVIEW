'''
1) Write a function that takes a string as an input
and returns a shuffled version of that string.
(i.e. a version where each character is just as likely to be
in any given position)

2) Write a function that analyzes how well your previous function
randomly shuffles the string.
How do this? Bernoulli Experiments.
The idea is to run shuffle len(string) times and check
how different the results are from 1 another
