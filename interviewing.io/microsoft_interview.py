Techincal Interview with a Microsoft engineer: K closest points
'''

'''
List of points:
List[List]: x,y
np.float distance
int k= 10: 10 closest points to the integer.
Point: vertex: (x,y)

Edge Case: Assume that we have 10 points and if we have less
then 10 points we return all the points.

Brute Force Approach:
N points, 1 Vertex.
Compute distance between all point pairs. --> Array Looping: N
Compute distance np.sqrt(point_n,vertex)
save all the distances: Space complexity O(n)
#sort this array: O(nlog(n)) --> average case
#O(nÂ²)log(n) --> computational complexity
O(n) --> spatial complexity

        sorted_index_pos = [index for index, num in sorted(enumerate(distances), key=lambda x: x[-1])]
        return [points[i] for i in sorted_index_pos][:k]

'''
Can we make this better? Yes
Lets make a queue K entries.
As we loop over the points:
    compute the distance.
    (2 pointers one left and one right)
    Put the first one on the far left. Lowest distance
    if next element is less than first put element far right
    if element less than far right right, put element right-1
