The question is only about two Sum:

Pseudocode for Second Question:
Given: list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], target = 15, continuous subarray from index 0 to 4, (0,4)

a) Build cummulative list until we reach the target or not exceeding the target
   cum_list = []
   sum = 0
   loop and update sum+=list[i] while sum <= target: index = 0, len(cum_list)

Edge Cases:
1) How long or short can the subarray be? --> If it can also be of one element,
   then just if a in list or if a in set(list) --> O(1) for set worst complexity
   vs O(n) worst complexity for list.

2) We can have negative numbers. Here we assume none.

3) Third edge case, current number during looping > target, skip it
Second example 2:
[4,5,2,3,7,5], target = 12 --> (1,3)


walkthrough interviewer here:
cum_sum = [4,6,9,16] --> stop.
j = 0
sum = 16, target = 12, sum-target = list[j]

return (j+1,i)

sum = 0
cum_sum = set([])
    for i in range(len(list)):
        if list[i]==target:
            return i #index
        else:
            if not list[i] <= target:
                sum+=list[i] #update the the sum
                cum_sum.add(sum) #keeps track of the cummulative sum, we also use set instead of list to optimise on the 'in' operation to optimse from O(n) time complexity to O(1) time complexity
                if not sum <= target:
                    break
                j = 0
                if (cum_sum-target) in list[j]:
                    return (j+1,i)
