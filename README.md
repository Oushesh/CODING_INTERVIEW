# CS-Fundamentals
My coding interview preparation. Materials from Leetcode, AlgoExpert.io, InterviewCake,

Online interviews recorded here: interviewing.io

## use Repl.it for fast coding test and in browser coding to avoid problems.

## use code sandbox pro for web development (startup mindset)

## TODOs.
   * (Build your own stuffs):Purchase Algoexpert and try all of them and kill the interview
   * Easy to refresh the code here.
