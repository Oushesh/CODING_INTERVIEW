## Abstract Class
   * Abstract Class -- Blueprint for other classes

   * When we want to provide a common interface for different implementations of a component, we use an abstract class.


   * Why use Abstract Base Class?
     By defining an abstract base class, you can define a common API for a set of subclasses.
     Useful when a 3rd party is going to provide implementations, such as plugins.


   * How does it work in python?
    Default -- Python -- no abstract classes.
    * Use decorator@abstractmethod.
    * from abc import ABC, abstractmethod this one

  * Example uses of abstract classes
    * TODO: why do we need them?
