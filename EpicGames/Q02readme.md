## Default Constructor C++
   * In C++, class methods are automatically generated by the compiler, under what circumstances, and what is their access protection and signature? Explain why you may not want to provide your own implementations of these methods:

      * The default constructor (when do you don't declare it yourself) has a public attribute.

      * The compiler will also automatically implicitly create a public copy constructor and copy assignment operator. (Paragraph 12.1.5 C++ standard)
        * Compiler generates move constructor if:
          * no user-defined copy constructor
          * no user-defined copy assignment constructor
          * no user-defined copy assignment operator
          * no user-defined move assignment operator
          * no user declared-desructor.
          * no "delete" marking

      * If the class definition does not explicitly declare a copy assignment operator, one is declared implicitly. If so, then the copy/move assignment operator is an inline public member.

      * The default constructor is one without arguments usually. You can also define user-defined constructors with function overloading and the constructors can co-exist together.
      Infinite number of constructors can be defined
      as long each has a unique signature(number & type of parameters) The default one has no argument.

      * You can actually not provide your own implementation of the default constructor or destructor
        * =default keyword tells the compiler to use the default implementation which means you cannot provide your own. The default constructor is the one called when no arguments are provided (signature). To disable the default constructor, use "=delete"
