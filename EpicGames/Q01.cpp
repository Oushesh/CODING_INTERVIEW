'''
You have been given 2 special, extremely rugged Xboxes.
You are in an office building that is 120 stories high.
Using the fewest possible number of drops from windows
in your office building, determine the highest
floor you can drop an Xbox from and have it survive:
for example, they might be able to take the drop from
the 30th floor, but not the 31st. You can break both
Xboxes in your search. State the worst case number
of drops needed and explain how you arrived at that
answer.
