This code is here to check whether a piece of string or array
is a palindrome.

Example: "anna" --> reversed --> "anna"

in python this is super simple-> just reverse the string and check.
it will work. what if instead we would have to find all the possible
palindrome substring within the given big string.


For example here: 'nn' is a palindrome, 'anna' is also a palindrome.
(its continuous)

What about this case? --> 'banna' , the only one
